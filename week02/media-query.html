            <h2>2 Nephi 25:23,29</h2>
            <p>
                For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be
                reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do.
                And now behold, I say unto you that the right way is to believe in Christ, and deny him not; and Christ is the Holy One
                of Israel; wherefore ye must bow down before him, and worship him with all your might, mind, and strength, and your
                whole soul; and if ye do this ye shall in nowise be cast out.
            </p>

            <p>
                For behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you that the Lord God worketh not in darkness.
                He doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world; for he loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own
                life that he may draw all men unto him. Wherefore, he commandeth none that they shall not partake of his salvation.
